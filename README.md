# Plant-Disease-Detection-System
This project utilizes deep learning (CNN) to build an AI-powered system that identifies plant diseases from leaf images, aiming to support sustainable agriculture. A user-friendly web-based platform is developed for real-time diagnosis, allowing users to upload images and receive instant feedback on potential plant diseases.
